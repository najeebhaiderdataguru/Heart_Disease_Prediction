# 🏥 Heart Disease Prediction using Deep Learning  

## **Overview**  
This project builds a **deep learning model using TensorFlow** to predict the risk of heart disease with **85% accuracy**. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in **early detection and intervention**, ultimately saving lives.  

## **Dataset**  
The model is trained on a heart disease dataset that includes patient information such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, chest pain type, and more.  

## **Features & Methodology**  
✔ **Data Preprocessing** – Standardization and feature engineering  
✔ **Deep Learning Model** – Built with **TensorFlow & Keras**  
✔ **Hyperparameter Tuning** – Optimized with **GridSearchCV**  
✔ **Performance Evaluation** – Achieved **85% accuracy**  

## **Installation & Usage**  
1️⃣ Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/najeebhaiderdataguru/Heart_Disease_Prediction.git
cd heart-disease-prediction
```
2️⃣ Install dependencies:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3️⃣ Train the model:  
```bash
python train_model.py
```
4️⃣ Make predictions on new patient data:  
```bash
python predict.py --input new_patient.csv
```

## **Results & Insights**  
- The model effectively identifies high-risk patients.  
- It can be integrated into **hospital decision support systems** to assist doctors.  
- Future improvements include **larger datasets** and **real-time deployment**.
